This project is an example that shows how we can use a model to fit another model and optimize the field selection.

- Step 1: Analysis: Explore data using graphics to get a first view.

- Step 2: Preprocessing: This is where the magic happens. We select, transform and prepare data to the model

- Step 3: Modeling: We can select 3 regression methods to predict price. I have implemented a code so
    that the model self-evaluates itself iteratively until it reaches the maximum possible simplicity
    without losing accuracy. Parameters are customizable (More info in main file comments)

- Step 4: YOUR TURN -> I have achieved an r2 = 0.94, can you beat me? Let me know if you get better performance ;)
